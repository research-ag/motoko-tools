# Motoko tools Docker image

This repository provides a Docker image containing essential tools for developing and building projects using the Motoko programming language on the Internet Computer. This image is optimized for creating reproducible builds and is available in multiple versions based on the Motoko compiler version.

## Image overview

The Docker image is built on node:22.7.0-bookworm-slim and includes the following components:

- [moc](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko)
- [mops](https://github.com/ZenVoich/mops)
- [ic-wasm](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm)

## Pull the image

To pull and use the image for your project, run the following command, replacing `<version>` with the tag of the desired version:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/research-ag/motoko-tools/motoko-tools:<version>
```

For example,

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/research-ag/motoko-tools/motoko-tools:moc-0.13.2
```

## Use as a base image

Alternatively, you can use the image as a base for your own Dockerfile, which is useful for setting up reproducible builds or CI/CD pipelines. Add the following line to your Dockerfile, replacing `<version>` with the tag of the desired version:

```
FROM ghcr.io/research-ag/motoko-tools/motoko-tools:<version>
```
